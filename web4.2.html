    <h1>Research Overview</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        introduced Hindu-Arabic numerals and the concepts of algebra into
        European mathematics. Latinized versions of his name and of his most
        famous book title live on in the terms algorithm and algebra.
        Al-Khwārizmī lived in Baghdad, where he worked at the “House of Wisdom”
        (Dār al-Ḥikma) under the caliphate of al-Maʾmūn. The House of Wisdom
        acquired and translated scientific and philosophic treatises,
        particularly Greek, as well as publishing original research.
        Al-Khwārizmī’s work on elementary algebra, Al-Kitāb al-mukhtaṣar fī
        ḥisāb al-jabr waʾl-muqābala (“The Compendious Book on Calculation by
        Completion and Balancing”), was translated into Latin in the 12th
        century, from which the title and term algebra derives. Algebra is a
        compilation of rules, together with demonstrations, for finding
        solutions of linear and quadratic equations based on intuitive geometric
        arguments, rather than the abstract notation now associated with the
        subject. Its systematic, demonstrative approach distinguishes it from
        earlier treatments of the subject. It also contains sections on
        calculating areas and volumes of geometric figures and on the use of
        algebra to solve inheritance problems according to proportions
        prescribed by Islamic law. Elements within the work can be traced from
        Babylonian mathematics of the early 2nd millennium bce through
        Hellenistic, Hebrew, and Hindu treatises.
